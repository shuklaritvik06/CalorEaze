# Calories Tracker API

The Calories API is a RESTful API that provides information about the calorie content of various food items you have consumed in the day.

### Features (Tasks)
- API Users must be able to create an account and log in.
- All API calls must be authenticated.
- Google OAuth
- Swagger UI
- Implement at least three roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on their owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD only users, and an admin would be able to CRUD all records and users.
- Each entry has a date, time, text, and number of calories.
- If the number of calories is not provided, the API should connect to a Calories API provider (for example, https://www.nutritionix.com) and try to get the number of calories for the entered meal.
- User setting â€“ Expected number of calories per day.
- Each entry should have an extra boolean field set to true if the total for that day is less than the expected number of calories per day, otherwise should be false.
- The API  able to return data in the JSON format.
- The API  provide filter capabilities for all endpoints that return a list of elements, as well should be able to support pagination.
- Unit and e2e tests.
- Use *Python* web framework
- Use *SQLite* as the database
